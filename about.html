            <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Hannah!  Ever  since I was  a little  girl I have always been fascinated by Butterflies. I spent a lot of my early years up in Northern Minnesota and  Canada with  my family. We spent our time in the woods during Fall, Winter, Spring and mostly  Summers. The summer  months  were always  my favorite because that is when the Kimmelpi (butterflies) were  most  prominent. I started to study them on my own, draw them, and care for my own. I made this website  because I wanted to specifically highlight the beautiful array  of butterfly's we have  in  Minnesota  as well  as share the  significance  butterflies are to our culture but as well our ecosystem and how we can learn and educate others of their unique beauty. </p>
